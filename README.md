# Player-Origin Statue Engine

A Minecraft resource pack for showing player statues in the game

This resource pack requires the data pack found at https://github.com/Bored-Face/pose-data.

## Future Plans

Although this pack has its 1.0 release, we still have plans for future updates

One of our plans is to make it much easier to add and load your own skins and capes.
